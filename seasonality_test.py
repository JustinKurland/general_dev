Yes, strong and consistent temporal patterns (e.g., seasonality or periodicity) can indicate that a system is automated. Quantifying and evaluating these patterns involves the following steps:

1. Assess Regularity in Temporal Patterns

Use time series decomposition (e.g., STL) to isolate the seasonal component and evaluate how dominant it is compared to other components (trend and remainder). A strong, repeating seasonal signal can suggest automation.

Key Metric: Seasonality Strength

Calculate the ratio of seasonal variance to total variance:

import numpy as np

# Calculate variance of components
seasonal_var = np.var(result.seasonal)
total_var = np.var(time_series)

# Seasonality strength
seasonality_strength = seasonal_var / total_var
print(f"Seasonality Strength: {seasonality_strength:.2f}")

If seasonality strength is close to 1, it suggests a dominant seasonal effect, possibly indicative of automation.

2. Detect Periodicity

Use Fourier Transform or Autocorrelation to detect regular periodic patterns in the time series.

Fourier Transform:

The Fourier Transform identifies dominant frequencies in the data, which can indicate periodicity.

from scipy.fftpack import fft
import numpy as np

# Apply Fourier Transform
fft_result = fft(time_series - time_series.mean())
frequencies = np.fft.fftfreq(len(fft_result))

# Identify dominant frequency
dominant_frequency = frequencies[np.argmax(np.abs(fft_result))]
print(f"Dominant Frequency: {dominant_frequency:.4f}")

A clear, dominant frequency suggests regular automated activity.

Autocorrelation:

Autocorrelation detects how strongly the time series correlates with itself at different lags, revealing periodic patterns.

from pandas.plotting import autocorrelation_plot

# Autocorrelation plot
autocorrelation_plot(time_series)
plt.title("Autocorrelation Plot")
plt.show()

Strong peaks at regular intervals can suggest automation.

3. Evaluate Remainder (Residuals)

If the residual component (remainder after removing trend and seasonality) is very small, it suggests that most variability is explained by predictable patterns, often a sign of automation.

Residual-to-Variance Ratio:

residual_var = np.var(result.resid)
residual_to_total_ratio = residual_var / total_var
print(f"Residual to Total Variance Ratio: {residual_to_total_ratio:.2f}")

A low ratio (< 0.1) indicates most of the activity is predictable, suggesting automation.

4. Quantify Predictability

Use models like ARIMA or Prophet to evaluate how well the time series can be predicted. If predictive accuracy is extremely high, this can indicate automated activity.

Key Metric: Prediction Error

Train a model on part of the data and evaluate prediction accuracy:

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import ExponentialSmoothing

# Train model
train = time_series.iloc[:-7]
test = time_series.iloc[-7:]
model = ExponentialSmoothing(train, seasonal="add", seasonal_periods=7).fit()
predictions = model.forecast(len(test))

# Calculate prediction error
mse = mean_squared_error(test, predictions)
print(f"Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse:.2f}")

Low error indicates high predictability, often a hallmark of automated systems.

5. Visualization for Automation Evidence

Combine all insights into a comprehensive visualization:

	•	Decomposed components (trend, seasonality, remainder).
	•	Autocorrelation or Fourier Transform results.
	•	Predictability metrics.

Example Interpretation

	•	High seasonality strength: Suggests repetitive behavior.
	•	Strong periodicity (from Fourier or autocorrelation): Indicates a consistent cycle.
	•	Low residual variance: Implies minimal randomness.
	•	High predictability: Supports the hypothesis of automated activity.
