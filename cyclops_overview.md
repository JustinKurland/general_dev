### PATH: Cyber Crime Automated Detection (CyCAD)

Details for the design, features, and implementation of **PATH CyCAD (Cyber Crime Automated Detection)**, a sophisticated tool aimed at automating threat hunting and cyber fraud investigation. It integrates multiple data sources, analysis modules, and reporting mechanisms to enable proactive detection, analysis, and response to cyber threats. The overarching goals are:

1. **Automation of Cyber Threat Detection:**
   - Automates processes like parsing, enrichment, and analysis of cyber activity data to identify malicious patterns.
   - Uses AI and machine learning (ML) techniques to detect fraud, credential-stuffing attacks, and anomalous behavior in real-time.

2. **Centralized Data Aggregation and Enrichment:**
   - Collects and correlates data from multiple sources (e.g., Akamai, Cloudflare, TMX, Azure Sign-In) into a unified dataset.
   - Enriches raw data using external APIs (e.g., Spur.us, urlscan.io) to provide additional insights, such as IP reputation, user-agent anomalies, and network behavior.

3. **Modular and Scalable Analysis Framework:**
   - Implements a modular architecture where each module is responsible for specific analysis tasks (e.g., DNS resolution, user-agent analysis, behavioral analysis).
   - Uses parallel processing (via Dask) to enhance scalability and reduce latency for large-scale data.

4. **Proactive Reporting and Response:**
   - Generates actionable insights through Security Incident Reports (SIRs) for events like account takeovers, suspicious login activity, and unusual money movements.
   - Enables teams to identify high-risk users or devices and respond to threats quickly through tools like ServiceNow and Grafana.

5. **Threat Intelligence and Advanced Correlation:**
   - Tracks cybercrime campaigns over time by analyzing user behavior, device profiles, TLS certificates, and domain activity.
   - Employs correlation techniques (e.g., cross-platform correlation) to link various data points, such as IPs, domains, and user agents, and identify relationships indicative of malicious activity.

### Key Capabilities:
- **Dataset Collection:** Ingests data from multiple internal and external sources, including logs, APIs, and sandboxes.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Compares current user behavior with historical patterns to identify anomalies like unusual login locations, failed login attempts, and bot-like behavior.
- **Threat Profiling:** Assigns scores and tags to activities based on their risk levels, such as "monetary transactions" or "phishing sophistication."
- **Orchestration:** Coordinates the execution of multiple modules to ensure comprehensive data enrichment and analysis.
- **Output:** Produces enriched datasets, CSVs of suspicious accounts/domains, and visualizations for monitoring tools like Grafana.

### Overall Aim:
The project is designed to **automate and enhance cybersecurity efforts** by providing a scalable, data-driven platform that integrates threat intelligence, real-time data analysis, and automated incident reporting. It aims to reduce manual efforts in threat hunting, improve the accuracy of anomaly detection, and provide actionable intelligence to analysts, enabling faster and more effective responses to cyber threats.

In essence, PATH CyCAD is a robust and forward-looking solution for combating cyber threats through automation, intelligence integration, and modular scalability. It addresses key pain points in manual threat hunting and provides a blueprint for future cybersecurity automation.
