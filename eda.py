Great! Now that you have the one-hot encoded columns, you can perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights. Here’s a structured approach for your EDA:

1. Check Basic Statistics

Get an overview of the data to understand the distribution of the one-hot encoded columns:

# Basic statistics of the one-hot encoded columns
df.describe(include=[int])

This will show the count, mean (percentage of rows with 1), and other statistics for each column.

	•	Columns with high mean values indicate frequently occurring features.
	•	Columns with low mean values are rare and may require special attention.

2. Identify Correlations

Find relationships between the one-hot encoded columns:

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Compute the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = df.corr()

# Plot the heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=False, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title("Correlation Heatmap of One-Hot Encoded Features")
plt.show()

	•	Look for highly correlated features (near +1 or -1), as they may represent similar patterns.
	•	Features with no correlation to others might represent unique phenomena.

3. Distribution of Features

Visualize how often each feature appears across rows:

# Sum the occurrence of each feature (column sums)
feature_distribution = df.iloc[:, 2:].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)

# Plot the distribution
feature_distribution.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(12, 6), title="Feature Occurrence")
plt.xlabel("Features")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()

	•	This helps identify which features are most common and which are rare.
	•	Rare features may require different treatment depending on the goal.

4. Group Rows by Feature Presence

Analyze combinations of features:

# Group rows by unique combinations of features
grouped = df.iloc[:, 2:].groupby(list(df.columns[2:])).size().reset_index(name='count')

# Display top combinations
grouped = grouped.sort_values(by='count', ascending=False)
print(grouped.head(10))

	•	This helps identify which combinations of features frequently occur together.

5. Visualize Feature Co-occurrences

Understand relationships between features that occur together:

# Co-occurrence matrix: how often features appear together
co_occurrence = df.iloc[:, 2:].T.dot(df.iloc[:, 2:])

# Plot the heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(co_occurrence, annot=False, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title("Co-Occurrence Matrix of Features")
plt.show()

	•	Larger values in the co-occurrence matrix indicate that two features frequently appear together.

6. Cluster Features

Perform clustering to identify groups of features that behave similarly:

from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage

# Perform hierarchical clustering
linkage_matrix = linkage(correlation_matrix, method='ward')
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
dendrogram(linkage_matrix, labels=correlation_matrix.columns, leaf_rotation=90)
plt.title("Hierarchical Clustering of Features")
plt.show()

	•	Features that cluster together may represent similar patterns in the data.

7. Feature Reduction

If the dataset has many one-hot encoded columns, use dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) to simplify the data:

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Apply PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca_result = pca.fit_transform(df.iloc[:, 2:])

# Plot the PCA result
plt.scatter(pca_result[:, 0], pca_result[:, 1])
plt.title("PCA of One-Hot Encoded Features")
plt.xlabel("Principal Component 1")
plt.ylabel("Principal Component 2")
plt.show()

	•	This can help identify latent patterns in the data and reduce noise.

8. Insights for Business Questions

	•	Frequent Features: Which features occur most often?
	•	Feature Combinations: Are there specific groups of features that co-occur?
	•	Rare Features: What are the unique or rare patterns in the dataset?

This structured approach will help you uncover insights and patterns in your data. Let me know if you’d like help with any specific analysis!
